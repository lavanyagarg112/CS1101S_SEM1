// for a pure function keep all the arguments and variables within the scope
// of the function and not access it from outside

/*

"A pure function is a function where the output is determined solely by its 
input values, without any side effects or dependency on external state. 
Given the same input, it will always produce the same output."

Key Characteristics:
Deterministic: For the same input, the function will always produce the 
same output.
No Side Effects: The function doesn't change or affect any state outside of 
itself; it doesn't read or write to external variables or data structures.
Independent: It doesn't rely on any external state or data.
Pure functions are foundational to functional programming, making code 
easier to test, debug, and understand.
