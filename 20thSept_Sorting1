// A list xs from a given Universe X, and a total order on X

// A permutation of xs such that each element is greater than or 
// equal to the previous one wrt each other

// comparisons only


// wishful thinking

// imagine we can sort lists with m elements, where m < n

// m can be n - 1
// or m = n/2

// using n-1

// insert the head in the right place, and sort the tail through wishful thinking
