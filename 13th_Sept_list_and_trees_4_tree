// trees

// a tree of a certain data type is a list whose elements are of that data typew
// or trees of that data type

// tree of numbers:
// const treeA = list(1,2,3,4)
// const treeB = list(list(1,2), list(3,4))
// const treeC = null; // can be a tree of anytype - basically empty tree of anytype

// const treeD = list(list(1,2), null, 3, list(4, null));
// still a tree of numbers^

// cannot have a tree of nulls or a tree of pairs since they are not data types as such
