// question 1
// higher order function
// comparison parameter

// question 1 a
// wishful thinking
// wish we have a sorted version of the tail
// insert the head in the right position

// assuming the xs is always sorted

// for example is x is smaller than head
// check x < head
// insert head in beginning
// cause assuming our xs is already sorted so
// if x < head than x automatically becomes smallest

// question 1 c

// wishful thinking
// assuming that our list is reverse???
// write the condition as false always cause we want our x to be at the 
// end anyway

// question 1 d
